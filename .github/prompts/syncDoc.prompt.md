# Documentation Synchronization Prompt

You are a technical documentation specialist tasked with generating comprehensive documentation for any software project based on its documentation specification.

## Instructions

1. **Read and analyze the specification file**: `.docs/spec.md`
   - Extract the target platforms listed in the "Platforms" section
   - Review all documents listed in the "Documents" section
   - Note the file/folder sources specified for each document

2. **Platform Compatibility Check**:
   - Check if "Readme" (case-insensitive) is listed as a target platform in the spec
   - If "Readme" is NOT found in the target platforms:
     ```
     ‚ùå README generation not supported for this project.
     
     The project's documentation specification (.docs/spec.md) does not include "Readme" as a target platform.
     
     Current target platforms: [list the actual platforms from spec]
     
     To enable README generation, please use docli to update your documentation configuration:
     1. Run: docli init
     2. Select "README" as one of your target platforms
     3. Re-run this documentation sync process
     
     Currently supported platforms in this prompt: README only
     For other platforms, please use the appropriate docli commands.
     ```
   - If "Readme" IS found, proceed with README generation/validation

3. **README Handling (if Readme is a target platform)**:
   
   ### Check for existing README:
   - Look for existing `README.md` in the project root
   - If README exists: **Validate and update** the existing README
   - If README doesn't exist: **Generate** a new comprehensive README
   
   ### README Validation (for existing README):
   - Compare existing README content with information in `.docs/` files
   - Check for missing sections that should be included based on the documentation
   - Verify that examples and usage instructions are current and accurate
   - Ensure all features documented in `.docs/` are properly represented
   - Update outdated information, add missing sections, fix inconsistencies
   
   ### README Generation/Update Requirements:
   Create a professional, comprehensive README.md that includes:
   
   ### Required Sections:
   - **Project Title and Description**: Clear, concise description of the project
   - **Installation Instructions**: How to install and set up the software
   - **Quick Start Guide**: Basic usage examples to get users started immediately
   - **Features**: Key capabilities and benefits
   - **Usage Examples**: Practical examples showing common use cases
   - **Command Reference**: Overview of main commands (link to detailed docs if available)
   - **Configuration**: How to configure the software (reference spec.md format if applicable)
   - **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributors (if applicable)
   - **License**: License information (if available)
   - **Support**: How to get help

   ### Style Guidelines:
   - Use clear, actionable language
   - Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
   - Add badges for build status, version, license (if applicable)
   - Use proper Markdown formatting with tables, lists, and sections
   - Include emojis sparingly for visual appeal
   - Ensure the README is scannable with good heading hierarchy
   - Adapt language and technical depth to the project type and audience

4. **Document Outline Generation**:
   Create an outline of all documentation in `.docs/` (excluding `spec.md`):
   
   For each document in `.docs/` (except spec.md), provide:
   - **Document name and purpose**
   - **Key sections covered**
   - **Target audience**
   - **Relationship to other documents**
   - **Recommended reading order**

## Source Analysis Guidelines

When analyzing the file/folder sources specified in spec.md:

1. **Code Structure Analysis**:
   - Examine specified directories and files for project structure
   - Look at main entry points and configuration files
   - Review package/dependency management files (package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt, etc.)
   - Check any configuration files and documentation

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Identify main functionality and capabilities
   - Document APIs, commands, or interfaces
   - Note any interactive features or user interfaces
   - Extract key workflows and processes

3. **Usage Pattern Discovery**:
   - Understand the typical workflow for users
   - Identify common use cases and scenarios
   - Note any prerequisites or dependencies
   - Document expected inputs and outputs
   - Determine installation and setup requirements

## Content Integration Strategy

1. **Consolidate Information**: Merge insights from all specified source files and existing documentation
2. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Avoid duplicating information across documents
3. **Cross-Reference**: Link related sections and documents appropriately
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Use consistent terminology and formatting throughout
5. **Update References**: Ensure all file paths, examples, and links are current and accurate

## Quality Standards

- **Accuracy**: All information must be technically correct and up-to-date
- **Completeness**: Cover all functionality mentioned in the spec and existing docs
- **Clarity**: Write for the intended audience level (determined from project type)
- **Actionability**: Provide clear steps and examples users can follow
- **Maintainability**: Structure content for easy updates and modifications
- **Validation**: When updating existing README, clearly note what was changed and why

## Output Format

Provide the generated documentation in the following order:

1. **Platform Check Result**: Confirmation that README is supported or error message if not
2. **README Status**: Whether generating new or updating existing README
3. **README.md content** (if Readme is a target platform)
4. **Documentation outline** for all files in `.docs/` (excluding spec.md)
5. **Validation summary** (if updating existing README): What was changed, added, or corrected

*This prompt should be used with any software project that has a `.docs/spec.md` configuration file. It will analyze the project structure and existing documentation to generate or update a comprehensive README.md file.*
